CodeKicker.BBCode.Core
=====================

This is a fork of the [original modification repository](https://github.com/Pablissimo/CodeKicker.BBCode-Mod).

## What's new
* fully compatible with netcore 3.1
* supports the bbcode uid feature of PHPBB 3.x. This feature is not fully documented anywhere, but [this forum thread](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=1378765) should be a good place to start.

## License
Both the original project and the modification repo are licensed under the MIT license, thus my changes are released under the same terms.
